Dear Me,

## Overview

It is a node application which is used to make notes about anything.
A user can:
 * **Add
 * **Remove**
 * **Read**
 * **List**
the notes.

This applicaition interacts with the user via command prompt.
**Yargs** and **Lodash** are the two packages which enables the application to work easily and to have a simple layout, while using command line. 

---

**Middleware** is also incorporated to the application so that one can physically view (the file in which the data is transferred as middleware) what has been written by the user, also enabling user to verify if there is any kind of problem with the application.
